## What is this?

The "brain" of the nascent Red Mountain Makers Internet of Things.  Running on
a Photon microcontroller.  So far it controls the ceiling lights via either a
button or a HTTP server that speaks JSON over the space's Wifi network.

See the
[project's wiki page](http://wiki.redmountainmakers.org/wiki/Project:Cortex)
